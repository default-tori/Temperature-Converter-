# Temperature-Converter-
This project is a simple temperature conversion program developed using C++. It allows the user to input a temperature value in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit using the standard mathematical formula.

1. Requirement Analysis
The main goal of this project is to create a simple system that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The system should:
Accept a temperature value in Celsius from the user
Convert the value to Fahrenheit
Display the converted temperature to the user.

3. Planning
The project was planned as a console-based application using the C++ programming language.
The program does not require external libraries or databases and focuses on basic input, processing, and output.

4. Design
The program follows a straightforward design:
Prompt the user to enter a Celsius temperature
Apply the conversion formula
F = (C × 9/5) + 32
Display the result in Fahrenheit
The design is linear and easy to understand.

5. Implementation
The system was implemented using C++.
Key programming concepts used include:
Variables to store temperature values
Input and output operations using cin and cout
Arithmetic operations to perform the conversion
The program converts the user’s input and displays the correct output.

6. Testing
The program was tested using different temperature values such as:
0°C
25°C
100°C
Each test produced the correct Fahrenheit output, confirming that the formula and logic work as expected.

8. Maintenance
Future improvements to the system may include:
Adding Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
Allowing multiple conversions in one run
Improving input validation
Adding a graphical user interface.
